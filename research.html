<strong><a href="https://jim2019.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/PottierWang.pdf">ANALYSES QUANTITATIVES DE LA MUSIQUE PAR DESMESURES REALISEES SUR DES SIGNATURES SPECTRO-TEMPORELLES DU SON</a></strong> (Conference Paper)<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>The objective of this project is to develop tools based on an automatic analysis technique of musical extracts that we have developed and which makes it possible to characterize the sound qualities perceived on short duration samples, on a scale of a few seconds. This analysis is both a spectral and temporal analysis and allows to characterize a sound extract from the point of view of the overall perceived timbre in the short term as well as the variations over time of its energy flow. It represents its sound signature at a given moment. Different measurements have been made on signatures and allow to establish similarities and distances between signatures of the same piece of music or by comparing different musics.  By operating on reference corpuses and performing automatic learning, we seek to realize different applications, concerning musicological analysis, recommendations for streaming and the development of new sound synthesis techniques.</p>

<strong>Dressing Up for the Regulators: Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</strong><br>with Puriya Abbassi, Rajkamal Iyer and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Government regulation requires effective supervision, but regulated entities may window-dress to supervisors.  For empirical identification, we analyze banks exploiting a quasi-natural experiment —ECB’s 2014 asset quality review (AQR)— in conjunction with the security and credit registers.  After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks decrease the share of riskier securities and loans, and level of overall securities and credit supply. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit.  Effects are stronger for banks with higher trading expertise.  Results suggest banks’ window-dressing for supervisory audits, especially on liquid securities that are easier to trade, and hold important implications for supervision.</p><br>
