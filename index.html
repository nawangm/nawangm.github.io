Welcome! My name is Na Wang-Maier and I am a data science and tech enthusiast based in Paris currently.

<br><br>
My interests lie in data science, machine learning and AI-related technologies. I would like to furthur explore the use case of AI and machine learning for business and societal applications, including marketing, e-commerce and smart cities. I am also interested in thinking about the impacts of AI to the society and believe as well as practice "AI for ALL, AI for GOOD". 

I had a decade of study and research experience using qualitative and quantitaive approaches for Social Science Research. Later I was dedicated more on data science, machine learning, IoT and AI techniques in general. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://nawangm.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> and my <a href="https://nawangm.github.io/tutorials" target="_self">tutorials</a> to learn more!
